## üè™ What is the average rating of app per store?
For the purpose of this question, let's divide our dataset into temporary tables. 
### Reviews from App Store.
Let's create temporary table with App Store reviews.
```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #temp_App_Store_reviews
CREATE TABLE #temp_App_Store_reviews(
Rating_App_Store int
)

INSERT INTO #temp_App_Store_reviews
SELECT rating FROM Reviews
WHERE source = 'App Store'
```

Now, we can query the average rating of Threads app in App Store and the number of reviews available.
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(Rating_App_Store) as Number_of_reviews_App_Store,
	AVG(Rating_App_Store) as Average_rating_App_Store
FROM #temp_App_Store_reviews
```
Answer: There are 2000 reviews with average rating of 2.

### Reviews from Google Play
Let's create temporary table with Google Play reviews.
```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #temp_Google_Play_reviews
CREATE TABLE #temp_Google_Play_reviews(
Rating_Google_Play int
)

INSERT INTO #temp_Google_Play_reviews
SELECT rating FROM Reviews
WHERE source = 'Google Play'
```

<img width="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sirmichal/Threads-app-reviews/blob/main/Q3.3.PNG">

Now, we can query the average rating of Threads app in Google Play and the number of reviews available.
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(Rating_Google_Play) as Number_of_reviews_Google_Play,
	AVG(Rating_Google_Play) as Average_rating_Google_Play
FROM #temp_Google_Play_reviews
```
Answer: There are 34943 reviews in Google Play with average rating of 3.

## üìà Average Rating Over Time
By calculating the average rating for each date, we can observe how user perceptions of the app have evolved. 
```SQL
SELECT
    MONTH(review_date) AS month,
	DAY(review_date) AS day,
    COUNT(*) AS review_count,
    AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM
    reviews
GROUP BY
    MONTH(review_date), DAY(review_date)
ORDER BY
    month, day
```
Answer: Observation which we can make is that over the time the number of reviews and rating has been in decreasing trend.

## üî¢ Number of reviews from the range of 2 and 4.
We would like to see the number of ratings from the range of 2 and 4 and additionaly compare it to number of other ratings. To see such information we need to use the below query.
```SQL
SELECT
	CASE 
		WHEN rating BETWEEN 2 AND 4 THEN 'rating range 2-4'
		ELSE 'other range'
	END AS Rating_range,
	COUNT(*) AS Number_of_ratings
FROM reviews
GROUP BY 
	CASE 
		WHEN rating BETWEEN 2 AND 4 THEN 'rating range 2-4'
		ELSE 'other range'
	END
```
Answer: There are 8661 ratings of the App from range between 2 and 4.
